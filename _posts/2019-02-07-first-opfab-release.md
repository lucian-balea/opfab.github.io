OpFab version [0.0.1.RELEASE](https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/releases/tag/0.0.1.RELEASE) is available on GitHub! 

We decided to tag this version because we thought we'd reached a point where OperatorFabric has the minimal set of features needed for people to start experimenting with it.
