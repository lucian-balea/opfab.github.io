The snapshot contains\nall information about the state of the router at the given point in time.\nThe entire snapshot is complex and not always needed. In this case, you only\nneed the URL and query parameters from the snapshot in the store. Other items could be\nreturned such as route parameters and static route data.\nsource: https://github.com/briebug/ngrx-complex-forms\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n    Constructor\n        \n            \n                \n                    \nconstructor(url: string, params: Params, queryParams: Params)\n                    \n                \n                        \n                            \n                                Defined in src/app/store/states/router.state.ts:37\n                            \n                        \n\n                \n                    \n                            \n                                    Parameters :\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                Name\n                                                    Type\n                                                Optional\n                                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                                \n                                                        url\n                                                  \n                                                        \n                                                                    string\n                                                        \n                                                  \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                \n                                                \n                                                        params\n                                                  \n                                                        \n                                                                    Params\n                                                        \n                                                  \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                \n                                                \n                                                        queryParams\n                                                  \n                                                        \n                                                                    Params\n                                                        \n                                                  \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                \n                                        \n                                    \n                            \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        import {RouterStateSerializer} from \"@ngrx/router-store\";\nimport {ActivatedRouteSnapshot, Params, RouterStateSnapshot} from \"@angular/router\";\n\nexport const initialState = {\n    state: {\n        url: window.location.pathname,\n        params: {},\n        queryParams: {}\n    },\n    navigationId: 0\n}\n\n/**\n * The RouterStateSerializer takes the current RouterStateSnapshot\n * and returns any pertinent information needed.
