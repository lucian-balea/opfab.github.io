The snapshot contains\nall information about the state of the router at the given point in time.\nThe entire snapshot is complex and not always needed. In this case, you only\nneed the URL and query parameters from the snapshot in the store. Other items could be\nreturned such as route parameters and static route data.\nsource: https://github.com/briebug/ngrx-complex-forms\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n    Constructor\n        \n            \n                \n                    \nconstructor(url: string, params: Params, queryParams: Params)\n                    \n                \n                        \n                            \n                                Defined in src/app/store/states/router.state.ts:37\n                            \n                        \n\n                \n                    \n                            \n                                    Parameters :\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                Name\n                                                    Type\n                                                Optional\n                                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                                \n                                                        url\n                                                  \n                                                        \n                                                                    string\n                                                        \n                                                  \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                \n                                                \n                                                        params\n                                                  \n                                                        \n                                                                    Params\n                                                        \n                                                  \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                \n                                                \n                                                        queryParams\n                                                  \n                                                        \n                                                                    Params\n                                                        \n                                                  \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                \n                                        \n                                    \n                            \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        import {RouterStateSerializer} from \"@ngrx/router-store\";\nimport {ActivatedRouteSnapshot, Params, RouterStateSnapshot} from \"@angular/router\";\n\nexport const initialState = {\n    state: {\n        url: window.location.pathname,\n        params: {},\n        queryParams: {}\n    },\n    navigationId: 0\n}\n\n/**\n * The RouterStateSerializer takes the current RouterStateSnapshot\n * and returns any pertinent information needed.

stand for Operating System.\n\nRun\nLinux\nAfter launching docker containers, use the following command line $OPERATOR_FABRIC_HOME/bin/run_all.sh start to run the application. Once the whole application is ready, you have at least the following kind of message in your terminal :\n##########################################################\nStarting client-gateway-cloud-service, debug port: 5008\n##########################################################\npid file: $OPERTAOR_FABRIC_HOME/services/infra/client-gateway/build/PIDFILE\nStarted with pid: 7479\n\n##########################################################\nStarting users-business-service, debug port: 5009\n##########################################################\npid file: $OPERTAOR_FABRIC_HOME/services/core/users/build/PIDFILE\nStarted with pid: 7483\n\n##########################################################\nStarting time-business-service, debug port: 5010\n##########################################################\npid file: $OPERTAOR_FABRIC_HOME/services/core/time/build/PIDFILE\nStarted with pid: 7488\n\n##########################################################\nStarting cards-consultation-business-service, debug port: 5011\n##########################################################\npid file: $OPERTAOR_FABRIC_HOME/services/core/cards-consultation/build/PIDFILE\nStarted with pid: 7493\n\n##########################################################\nStarting cards-publication-business-service, debug port: 5012\n##########################################################\npid file: $OPERTAOR_FABRIC_HOME/services/core/cards-publication/build/PIDFILEWait a few moments before trying to connect to the SPA, leaving time for the client-gateway to boot up completely. \nThe SPA, on a local machine, is available at the following Url: http://localhost:2002/ui/.\nTo log in you need to use a valid user. Currently you need to use a connection pair define in $OPERATOR_FABRIC_HOME/services/infra/auth/src/main/java/org/lfenergy/operatorfabric/auth/config/WebSecurityConfiguration.java. It could be admin with test, for example.\nTo test the reception of cards, you can use the following script to create fake ones:\n$OPERTAOR_FABRIC_HOME/services/core/cards-publication/src/main/bin/push_cards_loop.shOnce, logged in, with that script running in background, you should be able to see some cards displayed in http://localhost:2002/ui/feed.\nWindows\nNo script helpers provided for this OS. \nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in :\n$OPERATOR_FABRIC_CORE_HOME/services/web/web-ui/build/src/generated/resources/staticTest\nStandalone tests\nRun in the $OPERTAOR_FABRIC_HOME/ui/main directory the command ng test --watch=false to execute the unit tests based on Jasmine using Karma to drive the browser.\nTest during UI development\n\nif the RabittMQ and MongoDB docker containers are not not running, launch them;\nset your environment variables with . $OPERTAOR_FABRIC_HOME/bin/load_environment_light.sh;\nrun the micro services using the same command as earlier: $OPERTAOR_FABRIC_HOME/bin/run_all.sh start;\nif needed, enable a card-operation test flow using the script $OPERTAOR_FABRIC_HOME/service/core/cards-publication/src/main/bin/push_cards_loop.sh;\nlaunch an angular server with the command: ng serve;\ntest your changes in your browser using this url: http://localhost:4200 which leads to http://localhost:4200/#/feed.\n\nKnown Bugs\nLogin Page\n\nno
